For now just a way of doing 2D attractors in the form of

xnew=f(x,y,a,b,c,d)
ynew=g(x,y,a,b,c,d)
plot(xnew,ynew)
x=xnew
y=ynew

Features:
- fine control over output parameters
- moderately functioning parser for math expressions (mostly a mess right now)
- limited gradient support (for now just hardcoded)
